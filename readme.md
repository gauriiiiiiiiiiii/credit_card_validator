## **🧠 How it Works (The Luhn Algorithm)**

The Luhn algorithm ✨ is a checksum formula for validating identification numbers. Here's how it works:

- **Double Every Second Digit:** From the rightmost digit, double every second digit.
- **Sum Doubled Digits:** If a doubled digit is two-digits (e.g., 14), sum its individual digits (e.g., 1 + 4 = 5).
- **Sum All Digits:** Add all digits (doubled and undoubled).
- **Check for Multiples of 10:** If the total sum is a multiple of 10, the number is Valid! Otherwise, it's Invalid!
